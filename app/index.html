              <p>The  ‘Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh Foundation’ is holding its eighth conference on the legacy of Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh,  to take place at St Sava’s Church Hall, 89 Lancaster Road, London W11.</p>
              <p>
                 Entitled ‘Chaos and Beauty’, the conference will reflect on  Metropolitan Anthony’s  understanding of chaos as potentialities, and the ways in which this  relates to our experience of life, of God, of one another  and the world. We include below his own words on chaos – words which remain vital and relevant to the challenges we face today.</p>
              <div class="section__box"><img class="section__img-float hidden-xs" src="assets/images/about.jpg"><em>
                  <p>There are several aspects in chaos: a disorderly, disorganised state; the destruction of a pre-existing order;  and lastly, the fact that God created a world that held infinite  possibilities, a chaos pregnant with perfect Beauty when it will be ultimately unfolded; and that God called out of “possibility” (the original “chaos”) all that was basic or mature, and left it to men to help all other “Possibilities” to unfold and form a Cosmos, i.e. Beauty Unfurled and Revealed. I compared this Primaeval Chaos to the cell, which in the womb develops into an organised grouping of cells, then into a foetus, and ultimately matures to become a child who in his own turn will grow into full maturity - ideally  into the “full measure of the stature of Christ”. To organise, to freeze such a chaos, to stop its unfolding into all that it can become is a temptation, because, then, the chaos is tamed, subdued, enslaved and holds no fear for us; but it is the end of its becoming…  		</p>

                  p Questions for discussion:
                  p Activity is normally defined by its object. What is our attitude to nature? How does this attitude evolve in the history of mankind and in a life of a person?
                  p Global ecological problems, inflicted on nature by mankind and sustainability of our everyday life.
                  p The reality is such that mankind destroys nature rather than serve it. This is true not for individual ‘bad’ people but for all of us. All of us consume energy, travel by car or train, use plastic, etc. Can we do anything in order to solve this problem in everyday life? What can we do?
                  p Our body is a small part of the material world handed to us by God for our care. Does the way we treat our body reflects our attitude to the world around us (and/or the other way round)?

                  | A large proportion of our everyday life is dedicated to work. Some people consider their job as a calling, some – as a form of creative activity and self-expression, some – as a burden. We suggest discussing how our professional life is related to our Christian calling.

                  p A large proportion of our everyday life is dedicated to work. Some people consider their job as a calling, some – as a form of creative activity and self-expression, some – as a burden. We suggest discussing how our professional life is related to our Christian calling.
                  p Our intention is to create a space for discussion and to raise questions concerning the role of work in our lives and truly Christian attitude to work. We would also like to relate our experience to the experience and legacy of metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh.
                  p Questions for discussion:
                  p 1) How are work and ministry related in the life of a Christian, who is called to be God’s co-worker in all ways of life including professional life?
                  p 2) How can one discover motivation and meaning in a boring, routine job?
                  p 3) What can we do if our job is so tiring that we live the life to the full only on holidays?
                  p 4) Are there any special considerations for choosing a job for a Christian?

                .section__content#content-right
                  | The theme of the round table is what it means for us, Christians of the XXI century, to belong to a Church, what it means for us to be involved in a voluntary activity. What inspires us? And the opposite situation – why aren’t we involved in voluntary work?

                  p The theme of the round table is what it means for us, Christians of the XXI century, to belong to a Church, what it means for us to be involved in a voluntary activity. What inspires us? And the opposite situation – why aren’t we involved in voluntary work?
                  p How do we understand the nature of the Church and the vocation of a person in the context of it? In metropolitan Anthony’s parish it was a privilege and a joy to serve God and other people. What do we know about metropolitan Anthony’s views on the Church and on church ministry?
                  p Why is there an opinion that the Church is a place for self-realisation for those who fail in their secular jobs? Is voluntary work for the Church (choir singing, cleaning, teaching, etc) more Christian than secular jobs? Is there a difference between secular and church ministry? How do we understand liturgy after liturgy?
