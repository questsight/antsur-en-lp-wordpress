            <div class="section__content">
              <p>The aim of the conference is to consider how our belief in the Incarnate God, who came down to earth, lived among people, was crucified and rose from the dead affects our everyday life, our family life, our choice of profession, our attitude to education, to society, to culture, to time, to the world around us, to illness and to death.</p>
              <p>At our conferences we try to share our own experience but also to relate it to the legacy of metropolitan Anthony. There are many who witness that meeting him, one could feel his otherness and centeredness on Christ even in small everyday things. However his understanding of what makes a Christian is unusual in some aspects. He points out that our major sin is superficiality, he speaks about depth, attentiveness, responsibility, creativity, active life (as contrasted to re-active or to being acted upon), of creative chaos, belief in people (including oneself). He talks about human wisdom based on previous experience and about God’s wisdom which is eschatological, about our actions which are defined by the object instead of being centered on the person who is acting.  How much do his views and thinking correspond to our experience and understanding? How can we benefit from the legacy of this man of prayer?</p>
              <p>All are welcome.  Please send summary of your proposed talks (around 2000 letters) before 15 July to fondmas1@yandex.ru</p>

                    <p>According to Metropolitan Anthony every human being is called to be a priest of creation. How is it possible? Are we fulfilling our vocation? Are we at least trying to do something in this direction?</p>
                    <p>Questions for discussion:</p>
                    <p>Activity is normally defined by its object. What is our attitude to nature? How does this attitude evolve in the history of mankind and in a life of a person?</p>
                    <p>Global ecological problems, inflicted on nature by mankind and sustainability of our everyday life.</p>
                    <p>The reality is such that mankind destroys nature rather than serve it. This is true not for individual ‘bad’ people but for all of us. All of us consume energy, travel by car or train, use plastic, etc. Can we do anything in order to solve this problem in everyday life? What can we do?</p>
                    <p>Our body is a small part of the material world handed to us by God for our care. Does the way we treat our body reflects our attitude to the world around us (and/or the other way round)?</p>

                    <p>Questions for discussion:</p>
                    <p>1) How are work and ministry related in the life of a Christian, who is called to be God’s co-worker in all ways of life including professional life?</p>
                    <p>2) How can one discover motivation and meaning in a boring, routine job?</p>
                    <p>3) What can we do if our job is so tiring that we live the life to the full only on holidays?</p>
                    <p>4) Are there any special considerations for choosing a job for a Christian?</p>

                    <p>How do we understand the nature of the Church and the vocation of a person in the context of it? In metropolitan Anthony’s parish it was a privilege and a joy to serve God and other people. What do we know about metropolitan Anthony’s views on the Church and on church ministry?</p>
                    <p>Why is there an opinion that the Church is a place for self-realisation for those who fail in their secular jobs? Is voluntary work for the Church (choir singing, cleaning, teaching, etc) more Christian than secular jobs? Is there a difference between secular and church ministry? How do we understand liturgy after liturgy?</p>
